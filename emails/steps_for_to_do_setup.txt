Perfect ✅
We’ll make a **Google Apps Script** that:

* Sends you a **morning email** with your to-do list at 7 AM.
* Sends you a **night email** at 9 PM with a link to mark tasks done.
* Saves your responses in a Google Sheet for tracking.


 **Step-by-Step Setup**

1️⃣ Create a Google Sheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com).
2. Name it **Daily Tracker**.
3. Add columns:

   ```
   Date | 2 Hours Study | 1 Leetcode Problem | Workout / 10k Steps | No Sugar | Ice Face | Green Tea Twice
   ```



2️⃣ Open Script Editor

1. In your Sheet, go to **Extensions → Apps Script**.
2. Delete any existing code.



3️⃣ Paste This Code

```javascript
function sendMorningEmail() {
  var email = "YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com";
  var subject = "🌅 Morning To-Do List";
  var body = 
    "Good Morning!\n\nHere’s your to-do list for today:\n\n" +
    "✅ 2 hours study\n" +
    "✅ 1 Leetcode problem\n" +
    "✅ Any sort of workout / 10k steps\n" +
    "✅ No direct sugar, eat healthy\n" +
    "✅ Ice your face\n" +
    "✅ Green tea twice\n\n" +
    "Have a productive day! 💪";
  MailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body);
}

function sendNightEmail() {
  var email = "YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com";
  var formUrl = "PASTE_GOOGLE_FORM_LINK_HERE"; // Will create in step 4
  var subject = "🌙 Daily Task Completion Check";
  var body = 
    "Good Evening!\n\nPlease update your task completion for today:\n" +
    formUrl + "\n\n" +
    "Let’s keep the streak alive! 🔥";
  MailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body);
}
```



4️⃣ Create the Completion Form

1. Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com).
2. Create a new form titled **Daily Task Check**.
3. Add **6 Yes/No questions** for each habit:

   * “Did you study for 2 hours?”
   * “Did you solve 1 Leetcode problem?”
   * “Did you workout / walk 10k steps?”
   * “No direct sugar, ate healthy?”
   * “Did you ice your face?”
   * “Did you drink green tea twice?”
4. Link responses to the same **Daily Tracker Sheet** (in Form settings).
5. Copy the **form link** and paste it into the code (`formUrl`).



1. In Apps Script, click **Triggers** (clock icon on left).
I see the issue — your triggers are currently set to **“From spreadsheet - On open”**, which means the emails only send when you open the sheet.

To make them send **automatically at fixed times** (7 AM and 9 PM), you need to change these to **time-driven triggers**.


 **Change to Time-Driven Triggers**

1. In the Apps Script editor, click the **clock icon** on the left sidebar (Triggers).

2. Click **✏️ Edit** or **🗑 Delete** the existing triggers (those “From spreadsheet - On open” ones).

3. Click **+ Add Trigger** (bottom-right).

4. Set it like this for the **morning email**:

   * Function: `sendMorningEmail`
   * Event source: **Time-driven**
   * Type of time-based trigger: **Day timer**
   * Time of day: **7 AM to 8 AM**

5. Click **Save**.

6. Repeat for **night email**:

   * Function: `sendNightEmail`
   * Event source: **Time-driven**
   * Type: **Day timer**
   * Time: **9 PM to 10 PM**



6️⃣ Authorize & Run Once

* Click the play ▶️ button for each function once to authorize Gmail sending.



What Next?
Run Each Function Once Manually

In the Apps Script editor, select sendMorningEmail from the dropdown and click ▶ Run.

Do the same for sendNightEmail.

This will prompt Google to ask for permissions to send emails — click Authorize and allow it.
(Without this, the scheduled triggers won’t be able to send emails.)

Test the Emails

After authorizing, run each function once manually to make sure the email reaches your inbox.

Ensure Gmail & Form Links Work

For the night email, make sure the formUrl you added is correct and accessible.

If you linked the Google Form to your Google Sheet, the responses should already be set to go into your Daily Tracker sheet.

Leave It Running

Once authorized, Apps Script will run automatically from Google’s servers — you don’t need your laptop on.
